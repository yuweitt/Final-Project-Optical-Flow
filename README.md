# Final-Project-Optical-Flow

Team7 HLS Final Project  

## Major Optimization
* Streaming dataflow optimization 
* Pipeline Optimization
* Data Pack
* HLS Dataflow, which allowing functions and loops to overlap in their operation, increasing the concurrency of the RTL implementation.

## How to produce your own Dataset ???
Current kernel take five consecutive frames as input. To test optical flow on your own video, you'll have to convert mp4 to ppm manually.

1. Convert mp4 to ppm  
We refer to this github page [MP4-video-to-JPG-batch-converter](https://github.com/jasonmayes/MP4-video-to-JPG-batch-converter)  
Shell script is in data/MP4-video-to-JPG-batch-converter
